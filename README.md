# "Exploring_the_Vital_Signs:A_Comprehensive_Analysis_of_Student_Health_and_Lifestyle Data
In the realm of academia, understanding the holistic well-being of students extends far beyond grades and textbooks. The "Exploring the Vital Signs" data analytics project delves into the intricacies of student health and lifestyle, harnessing the power of data to unveil patterns, correlations, and insights. 
This data analytics project stands as a testament to continuous learning and application in the field of data analysis. As part of a weekly task within a comprehensive data analysis training program, this endeavor not only sharpens analytical skills but also positions itself at the intersection of academia and practical insights.

## Data Cleaning
I initiated the process by importing the file into Excel, converting it from a CSV format. Subsequently, I established a user-friendly data table to facilitate seamless navigation. Recognizing the presence of numerous gaps in the data, I computed column averages for variables with values. Employing filters per column, I isolated the blanks and replaced them with the computed averages. In instances where values were entirely absent, I strategically inserted "Unspecified" to maintain data integrity.
